# Non-Linear-System-Control---A-Naive-Approach-

## Introduction
In this project, a linear approach is apllied as an attempt to control a non-linear system. The aim is to design PID controllers (Proportional Integral Derevitive controllers) to do the task.The system we are trying to control is a MIMO system where we want to have two desired outputs out of many.
