# Non-Linear-System-Control---A-Naive-Approach-

## Introduction
In this project, a linear approach is apllied as an attempt to control a non-linear system. The aim is to design PID controllers (Proportional Integral Derevitive controllers) to do the task.The system we are trying to control is the twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (MIMO) where we want to have two desired outputs out of many. 

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to figure out wether or not a linear controller is able to compensate a nonlinear system.

## Tools Used
The main tool for this project is MATLAB. Several Tools in MATLAB were used such as multisim, S-function, and SISO-tool.

## Approach
The conventional approachs of designing a linear controller were applied in this project. For instance, pole-zero maping which is illustrated through the PDF document was utilized more than once.
